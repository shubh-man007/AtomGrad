>>Inspired by Pytorch's autograd engine, atomgrad works on scalar values and can backpropagate through DNNs.
>>Uses the Graphviz Library to visualize the neural network and stores updated values of weights and losses.
>>Atomgrad has been tested out on basic regression problems using a custom scalar dataset and have achieved accuracy close to that of pytorchs model.
